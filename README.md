### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am Niraj Shukla
I work on
- Ruby on Rails
- ReactJs
- Typerscript 
- CI/CD using different solutions such as Gitlab, CircleCI etc.
- Currently learning Kubernetes and Prometheus
- Like to work on monolithic applications, and don't see the point of having microservices, unless you can afford to have atleast one team per microservice( or couple of microservices)
I enjoy working on applications from end to end. Cheers!
